Alright! Time for some CSS. But first we talked a lot more about using Git and GitHub. I thought I was understanding it until I came home and talked to Gene about it. Turns out I was missing some key points. I think it will take a while to get used to. I'm starting to see how it's a pretty powerful tool once you can navigate it. 

Kept working on our personal sites. They sure made some leaps and bounds once we started adding CSS. I'm pretty proud of my buttons that change color. I still have a long way to go in terms of layout but it's fun knowing enough to play around with. Not sure if it's good or bad, but Gene's not a lot of help with the CSS. I'm guessing Google will be my best friend over the next 10 weeks.
